# Storage

Juno Storage is designed for app developers who need to store and serve user-generated content, such as photos or videos.

It offers a powerful and cost-effective object storage solution on the blockchain.

:::note

To use Juno Storage's features, you must [install](../add-juno-to-an-app/install-the-sdk-and-initialize-juno.md) and initialize the Juno SDK in your app.

:::

## How does it work?

Each [satellite] you create has a "Storage", which can contain assets (photo, document, video etc.) that are automatically made available on the internet.

A "Storage" can have as many collections as you wish.

A collection contains a list of assets. Each of these is a record that holds the data you want to persist on chain, along with an associated owner (the creator of the asset).

The associated owner is used to grant listing and write permissions.

Each asset is identified by a `path` - e.g. `/images/a-user-image.jpg` - unique within every collection.

:::caution

Unless you use the optional `token` parameter to persist an asset in your [satellite] and make its URL difficult to guess, any asset stored in Juno Storage will be publicly available on the internet.

:::

## Limitation

Each [satellite] can hold up to 32GB of data for all services combined.

## Collections and rules

You can create or update collections and their rules in the "Rules" tab in Juno's console under the [storage](https://console.juno.build/storage) view.

:::caution

Assets remain publicly available on the internet regardless of the permission schema. The rules are only applied when accessing the data through the library.

:::

A collection's read and write permissions can be set as `public`, `private`, `managed`, or `controllers`.

- `public`: everyone can read from (resp. write to) any asset in the collection
- `private`: only the owner of a asset and can read from (resp. write to) a document in the collection
- `managed`: the owner of an asset _and_ the [controllers] of the satellite can read from (resp. write to) an asset in the collection
- `controllers`: only the [controllers] of the satellite can read from (resp. write to) any asset in the collection

:::tip

- Rules can be modified at any time and changes will be immediately applied
- Any collection with read permission set as`public`, `managed` or `controllers` can be viewed in the Juno console's [storage](https://console.juno.build/storage) view.

:::

### Additional rules

In addition to the permissions, you can set an optional parameter to limit the size (in bytes) of the assets that can be uploaded in a collection.

## Upload asset

To upload an asset, use the following code:

:::note

Uploading a file with the same name as an existing file will overwrite the previous file.

:::

```typescript
import { uploadFile } from "@junobuild/core";

const result = await uploadFile({
  data,
  collection: "images",
});
```

The `data` parameter is the file you want to upload. This is commonly selected using an HTML `<input type="file" /> ` element.

The `uploadFile` function provides various options, including:

- `filename`: By default, Juno uses the file's filename. You can overwrite this and provide a custom filename. Example: `myimage.jpg`.
- `fullPath`: Juno will automatically compute the `fullPath`, which is the **unique** path that is used to make the asset available on the internet. The `fullPath` is the filename encoded as a URL and prefixed with `/`. Example: `/images/myimage.jpg`.
- `headers`: The headers can affect how the browser handles the asset. If no particular header is provided, Juno will extract the `Content-Type` from the file type.
- `encoding`: The type of encoding for the file. For example, `identity` (raw) or `gzip`.

### Protected asset

While all assets can be found on the internet, it is possible to make their URL difficult to guess so that they remain undiscoverable (**as long as they are not shared**) and considered "private".

Juno achieves this by using the `token` query parameter.

```typescript
import { uploadFile } from "@junobuild/core";
import { nanoid } from "nanoid";

const result = await uploadFile({
  data,
  collection: "images",
  token: nanoid(),
});
```

For example, consider uploading a file "mydata.jpg" with a token. Attempting to access it through the URL "https://yoursatellite/mydata.jpg" will not work. The asset can only be retrieved if a token is provided: "https://yoursatellite/mydata.jpg?token=a-super-long-secret-id".

## List assets

The "Storage" provider offers a way to list assets.

```typescript
import { listAssets } from "@junobuild/core";

const myList = await listAssets({
  collection: "images",
  filter: {},
});
```

The `listAssets` function - in addition to specifying the collection to query - accepts various optional parameters:

- `matcher`: a regex to apply to the assets' `fullPath`
- `paginate`: an object used to query a subset of the assets
- `order`: requests entries sorted in ascending or descending order

## Delete asset

To delete an asset, it must be listed first. This ensures that only the most recent asset is deleted.

```typescript
import { deleteAsset } from "@junobuild/core";

await deleteAsset({
  collection: "images",
  storageFile: myAsset,
});
```
