# Getting started

Welcome to Juno, an open-source Blockchain-as-a-Service platform that makes building web3 apps faster and easier than ever before ‚ö°Ô∏èüöÄü§Ø.

Unlike traditional Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms like Google Firebase or AWS Amplify, Juno runs entirely on the blockchain.

It allows you to outsource all the behind-the-scenes aspects of your web or mobile development, giving you the ability to focus on the frontend.

At Juno, privacy is a top priority and the platform operates without controlling your data or work. With Juno, you truly own your creations.

## Closed beta üëÄ

Juno is currently in closed beta. If you would like to participate, reach out to David on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daviddalbusco) or through his [Contact](https://daviddalbusco.com/#contact) page to request an invitation code.

## Add Juno to your JavaScript project

To get started with Juno, follow our [guide](add-juno-to-an-app/create-a-satellite.md) to launch your first [satellite](terminology.md#satellite) and integrate our JavaScript SDK into your project.

## Build

Build and launch your project with the help of our [authentication](build/authentication.md), [datastore](build/datastore.md), [storage](build/storage.md), and [hosting](build/hosting.md) services.

## Learn concepts

Learn about Juno's [infrastructure](category/infrastructure) and [architecture](architecture.md) to fully understand how it works.
